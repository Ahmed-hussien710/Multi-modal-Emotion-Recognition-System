🧠 Goal
Build a multi-modal emotion recognition system that identifies human emotions based on text data (possibly audio or visual modalities too, but the current code focuses on text).

🧰 Main Tools & Libraries
PyTorch for model training
Transformers (e.g., BERT) for NLP
HuggingFace Datasets for loading the GoEmotions dataset
scikit-learn for evaluation (e.g., accuracy, F1)
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization

📑 Dataset
GoEmotions: A labeled dataset with over 58K Reddit comments annotated with 27 emotion labels.
Each sample may have multiple emotion labels (multi-label classification task).


🔍 What the Notebook Does
Installs and imports necessary libraries
Loads the GoEmotions dataset
Visualizes the label distribution to understand class balance
Tokenizes the text data using a pre-trained model like bert-base-uncased
Creates DataLoaders for training and evaluation
Defines a model for multi-label emotion classification using BERT
Trains the model using binary cross-entropy loss (appropriate for multi-label problems)
Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score
(Optional) Saves the model or visualizes predictions

🧪 Model Architecture
Uses a pre-trained BERT model
Adds a custom classification head on top (fully connected layer)
Applies sigmoid activation to get probability per emotion label

📈 Output
Trained model that can predict emotions from text
Metrics to evaluate how well it performs
(Possibly) saved results, graphs, or confusion matrix plots
